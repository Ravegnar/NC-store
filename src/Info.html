NSO

Nanite Systems Operatives are a 'faction' of unaffiliated, remotely-controlled combat units 
created by Nanite Systems, whose allegiance is sworn to no single empire.

Nanite Systems Operatives are robotic units contracted out to the other factions. They are 
considered a "fourth faction" despite being "assigned" to the faction with the lowest-population on the continent.

Nanite Systems Operatives (NSO): Nanite Systems Operatives are not a unified group of soldiers, but rather robot 
mercenaries who hold no allegiance to any faction and fight on a contractual basis for the highest bidder. Nanite 
Systems staff operate these robotic units remotely by proxy, much unlike the fully human combatants the three factions 
typically employ.[43] NSO units are automatically assigned to the Terran Republic, New Conglomerate or Vanu 
Sovereignty depending on which faction has the lowest population, but can also remain loyal to one faction
unconditionally (available only to subscribed players in-game).[44] Although they lack access to other empires'
 weapons and vehicles, NSO units can use all common pool equipment, which emphasizes versatility and utility, 
 in addition to their own unique arsenal of weapons and vehicles.


NS

Nanite Systems produces a pool of common weapons, equipment, and vehicles that are available for all three empires. 
Items created by Nanite Systems offer quite a large deal of customization options. All posts' banners and signs 
revert to Nanite System's logo and colors when they are unowned by any empire.  

Nanite Systems was once a small company on Earth that researched and developed nanotechnology and worked with 
the Terran Republic, building prefabricated buildings for the expeditions through the wormhole. Since 
re-establishing business on Auraxis and being integral in the discovery and production of modern Nanite 
technology, they have branched out to other industries such as rebirth technology, vehicle design, and 
weapon design. Nanite Systems manages to stay neutral in the Auraxian War conflict by providing military 
contract work to all three factions, plus providing the vital rebirthing services which keep Auraxians 
immortal. Thus they have remained safe from takeover by any one faction. 

NS weapons have neutral color tones of tan, black, and white. The designs are a combination of every empires' 
characteristics, serving as a middle ground between all three factions in terms of performance. The exception 
to this rule are the pistols and rocket launchers, as these weapons have an emphasis on power over all else.  

Almost every Empire's standard equipment pieces (Medical Applicator, Nano-Armor Kits, Recon Detectors, etc) 
are designed and produced by Nanite Systems, as well as common vehicles such as the Sunderer or Valkyrie.
